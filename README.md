# StudyOS

Learn. Build. Focus. Evolve.

This repository contains the first native Android foundation for **StudyOS**, a Cyber Pulse product.

## Included now

- Kotlin and Jetpack Compose Android project
- Dark neon liquid-glass interface
- Home, workspace, progress and settings navigation
- Local activity log and configurable focus timer
- Offline-first preferences and progress
- Unit test and GitHub Actions APK build
- No embedded API keys or fake cloud connection

## Firebase phase

Firebase is deliberately deferred. Authentication, Firestore/Realtime Database, remote sync, Cloud Functions and App Check should be added together after the Firebase projects and security rules are agreed.
